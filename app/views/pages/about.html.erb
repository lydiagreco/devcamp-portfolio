        <p> I always thought I would grow up to be a lawyer and spend my day arguing in a courtroom. Now, I am a software developer, and I spend my days arguing with myself behind a computer screen. I wouldn't have it any other way. </p>

       <p> Ever since I was little, my plan was to graduate with a degree in constitutional studies and go straight to law school. In 2015, I graduated from Utah State University with a degree in Law and Constitutional Studies. Rigth before graduation, I had been observing my new husband who was beginning his degree in Computer Science. I watched him code and thought 'I bet I could do that...I bet I could do that better than him!'</p>

        <p>That was the beginning of a long, exciting, life-changing journey for the both of us</p>

        <p> At the start of 2017, we enrolled in a well-known coding bootcamp through Bottega Tech based out of Lehi, Utah. We enrolled part time, as money was tough and we had moved to South-eastern Idaho for work. Now, at the beginning of 2018, I am on the cusp of graduating with my Junior Software Development certificate, and I am eager to start working as soon as possible. </p>
