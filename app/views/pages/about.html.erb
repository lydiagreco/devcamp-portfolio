    <p>In 2015 I graduated Utah State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Law and Constitutional Studies. Although it had been my childhood dream to become a lawyer, after graduation I quickly realized that my passions had evolved and I became fascinated with Computer Programming and Software Development. I am currently enrolled in classes at Devcamp, where I am learning how to use Ruby on Rails to create applications and manage data flow. </p>

    <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
